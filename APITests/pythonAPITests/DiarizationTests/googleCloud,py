# The transcript within each result is separate and sequential per result.
# However, the words list within an alternative includes all the words
# from all the results thus far. Thus, to get all the words with speaker
# tags, you only have to take the words list from the last result:
result = response.results[-1]

# Printing out the output:
for word_info in words_info:
    print(f"word: '{word_info.word}', speaker_tag: {word_info.speaker_tag}")
