 "Happy halloween Mark I'm a little scared there's ghosts around"
 "what do you mean there's ghosts around that's silly"
  "I saw some books flying around they don't normally do that"
   "yeah they normally just slide across the floor"
    "wait no they don't did you see ghosts too"
    "wait you're telling me these books are not supposed to be sliding across the floor and hitting people"
    "no that must be ghosts ghosts are throwing books around oh no"
