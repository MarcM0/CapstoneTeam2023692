"Hello Steven how are you doing today"
"hi Mark I'm doing quite well how are you doing"
"well you know I have mixed emotions today I've recently picked up painting but it's not going how I would like"
"I'm sorry to hear that what's been going on"
"well I'm just struggling to find the time to get the painting in like I enjoy the actual process of drawing but then I have work to do and I feel like I'm wasting time so I'm not sure what to do"
