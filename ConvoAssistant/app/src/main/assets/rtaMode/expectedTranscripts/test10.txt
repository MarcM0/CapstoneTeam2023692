"hi Stephen do you have any plans this weekend"
 "Ya, I actually do, I'm going skiing in the mountains what about you?"
 "I don't actually have anything to do I feel like life is getting pretty boring"
 "I'm sorry you feel that way, why do you feel like that though"
 "I feel like ever since I got into the rhythm of work and being married and kids it just I have all these responsibilities that are repetitive and not letting me live for myself in a way that is fulfilling to me"
