"wow look at those people over there they're all purple"
"woah that's strange I've never seen people color themselves that way why are they doing that"
"I believe it is an engineering tradition where they dye themselves every year"
"interesting but what does purple have to do with engineering"
I believe it is a story from world war two where canadian engineers would wear purple armbands and the steam from the boiler room would cause the dye to leak out dying their arms purple"
"interesting I wish our discipline had cool traditions like that"
